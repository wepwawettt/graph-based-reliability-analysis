# Type-Aware Anomaly Detection and Safe Repair for Time Series

This project presents a **type-aware, drift-sensitive anomaly detection and repair pipeline** for univariate time series.
Unlike naive anomaly correction methods, the proposed approach **distinguishes between spike anomalies and concept drift**, and applies **confidence-gated repairs** to guarantee safety.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Robust STL-based decomposition** (trend / seasonal / residual)
- **MAD-based spike anomaly detection** with high recall
- **Slope-aware drift detection** using sustained trend changes
- **Type-aware anomaly classification**
  - Spike
  - Spike-in-drift
  - Moderate deviation
- **Confidence-weighted repair mechanism**
  - Repairs applied **only to safe spike anomalies**
  - Drift regions explicitly excluded from repair
- **Explainable anomaly decisions**
  - z-score, confidence, drift-awareness per anomaly
- **Safety guarantees**
  - Zero negative-impact repairs observed
  - Conservative repair policy inside drift

## 🧠 Method Overview

1. **STL decomposition** is applied to isolate residual anomalies.
2. **Spike anomalies** are detected using a robust MAD-based z-score.
3. **Concept drift** is identified via sustained slope changes in the trend.
4. Each anomaly is **explained and classified** based on magnitude and drift context.
5. **Repairs are applied only when safe**, using:
   - Trend + seasonal reconstruction
   - Confidence-weighted blending
6. Drift regions are **explicitly protected** from forced corrections.

## 📊 Quantitative Results (Synthetic Injection)

| Metric | Value |
|------|------|
| Precision | 0.319 |
| Recall | 0.759 |
| RMSE (before repair) | 305.43 |
| RMSE (after repair) | 177.12 |
| RMSE (drift excluded) | 78.07 |
| Avg repair improvement | **97.8%** |
| Repair safety rate | **100%** |
| Spike repair coverage | **100%** |

> Although detection precision is intentionally relaxed to maximize recall,
> the repair module is conservative and confidence-gated, ensuring **zero negative impact**.

🔬 Design Philosophy
Detection ≠ Repair

Recall is prioritized during detection.

Repair decisions are type-aware, confidence-weighted, and drift-sensitive.

The system is designed to be safe by construction.
